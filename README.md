"Covid Chase" is a 2D local-multiplayer Covid-themed tag game made with Unity by Cole Bennett

This game began as a way for me to learn Unity, game development, and improve my programming language, but I have grown proud of my work and want to get it to a point where I can show it to possible employers and my peers.

I worked on this game by myself but used some code written by zigorous (https://github.com/zigurous) from his recreation of Bomberman on Unity. I also took inspiration from Bomberman's (Nintendo) art to create my sprites.
